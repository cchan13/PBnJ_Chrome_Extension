# PBnJ Chrome Extension
Fighting the effects of Political Bias in Journalism

News bubbles have played a key role in increasing political polarization. To combat this, our team has created a Chrome extension that both calculates a bias score for online news articles to inform users of the political leanings of their current news sources and presents summaries of related articles to show key arguments from other parts of the political spectrum. We aim to provide users with context for the news they read and easy access to a fuller picture of current events.
